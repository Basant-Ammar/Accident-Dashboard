# 🚗 Accident Data Analysis - Tableau Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes accident data from 2019 to 2022 to identify trends, risk factors, and actionable insights for improving road safety. An interactive **Tableau Dashboard** has been created to visualize key metrics, such as total accidents, casualties, weather conditions, lighting conditions, and geographic distribution.

## 📊 Key Features
✅ **Interactive Dashboard** – Explore accident trends, casualty statistics, and location-based insights.  
✅ **Data Storytelling** – A structured report summarizing key findings and recommendations.  
✅ **Geospatial Analysis** – A heatmap showcasing accident hotspots.  
✅ **Trend Analysis** – Insights into how accidents changed over the years.  
✅ **Publishing & Documentation** – Available on **Tableau Public** and GitHub for open access.

## 📜 Insights & Recommendations
🔹 Most accidents occurred in **2019**, with a decline in **2020-2021** and a slight rise in **2022**.  
🔹 **Weather conditions** had minimal impact, as most accidents occurred in **clear weather**.  
🔹 **Lighting conditions** significantly influenced accidents, with a high number occurring at night.  
🔹 **Geospatial analysis** identified accident hotspots, highlighting areas needing improved traffic control.  

### 🚀 Recommendations:
✔ **Enhance street lighting** in high-risk areas.  
✔ **Implement stricter traffic laws** for nighttime driving.  
✔ **Improve road infrastructure** in accident-prone zones.  
✔ **Launch public awareness campaigns** on safe driving habits.
